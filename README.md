# About Me
I study computer science at Acadia University in Wolfville. During my time there, I have developed an extensive interest in development, networking, and Linux administration. I have a strong background in website development and started designing websites early in my studies. I have learned a great deal about how websites work and have focused my studies on website development.
I have always had a strong commitment to UI/UX design, as I found an intuitive interface goes a long way while developing an application. From there I began to develop in Node.js both as a service, and desktop applications using Electron. Most of the projects that I have written have been in Node.js, however, I have dabbled in many different languages in the past.

While at Acadia, I have learned how to program in C, Java, and of course Node.js. More recently, I have been attempting to integrate typescript into my projects in an attempt to give myself more control over my applications.

Besides development, I am also heavily interested in hardware and networking. I manage and operate an Unraid server with approximately 40TB of storage, with an additional 2TB of cache. As for networking, I have been using a PFsense firewall to protect and serve the services I run on the server. Recently I have been working on getting 10-gigabit networking running throughout the network.

# Experience 
## Development
Most of my development experience comes from projects done at Acadia, and projects I have written for personal use cases. These projects can be found on my Github page:

### **[ATM Bank Project](https://github.com/GlennCottam/ATMBankApplication)**: 
Languages: Java, CSS, HTML
Platform: Desktop
Purpose: The ATM Bank Application was for Software Engineering 1, where our group made an application that was meant to add and subtract funds from an account, with account management. During this project, I created the frontend of the platform using FXML in Java.
  
### **[MarkNote Capstone Project](https://github.com/GlennCottam/MarkNote)**: 
Languages: Javascript, CSS, EJS, SCSS
Platform: Web / PWA / Google Cloud Platform
Purpose: Marknote was my Capstone project I completed this year. It is a markdown writing software that is browser-based and can be installed in a PWA. Marknote runs on the Google Cloud Console as an independent application and uses the user's Google Drive to save and load files. Feel free to check the live demo out at: https://marknote.ue.r.appspot.com/.


## Linux and Server Admin
I manage my Unraid server consisting of about 40TB of space, dedicated for file storage, backups, and a media library.

The Unraid server comes with the PFsense firewall, which prevents intrusion, and allows for precise configuration of the network to allow the Unraid server to host various services efficiently using a combination of DNS and Proxy services. I have also configured services in PFsense including NAT, UPnP, Traffic Shaping via HFSC scheduler, and an internal DNS resolver.

The traffic shaper I have implemented is a solution to the limited upload bandwidth I have on the home network. It allows services to use the full amount when nothing else requires the bandwidth and will drop or throttle the connection when that upload bandwidth is needed by another service. It like many things I do is still a work in progress, but I am quite happy with the result.

I am proficient with most modern operating systems including MacOSX, Windows 10, and mainline Linux distributions including Manjaro, Ubuntu, and Debian.


# Current Projects
As of right now, I am between projects as my main goal is to upgrade my current networking to 10-Gigabit with the use of fibre optics.

However, I still plan to continue adding to MarkNote as time goes on, as there is much more to do with the project, and I believe it could be incredibly useful not just by itself, but as something that could be added to other projects down the road.
