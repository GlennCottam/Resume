<!-- # About Me
I am currently attending Acadia University studying Computer Science. I have developed several independent projects mostly writtin in Node.js, as it is my strongest language. -->

## Languages, Frameworks, and Tools

  - EJS
- NoSQL, SQL
  - MongoDB

- Recently started working in Typescript

## Experience 
### Development
Most of my development experience comes from projects done at Acadia. These projects can be found on my Github page:

- ATM Bank Project: https://github.com/GlennCottam/ATMBankApplication
- MarkNote Capstone Project: https://github.com/GlennCottam/MarkNote

The ATM Bank Application was for Software Engineering 2, where our group made a application that was meant to add, and subtract funds from a account, with account management. During this project, I created the frontend of the platform using FXML in Java.

My MarkNote Capstone project was independently created by me, is a application that is meant to write markdown files directly in the user's Google Drive account. The application itself has a usable demo on https://marknote.ue.r.appspot.com/. Marknote itself has been developed on Google Cloud Console, which was my first extensive project on the platform.

### Linux and Server Admin
I manage my own Unraid server consisting of about 40TB of space, dedicated for file storage, backups, and a media library.

With the Unraid server, comes with the PFsense firewall, which prevents intrusion, and allows for precise configuration of the network to allow the Unraid server host various services effecitently using a combination of DNS and Proxy services. I have also configured services in PFsense including NAT, UPnP, Traffic Shaping via HFSC scheduler, and a internal DNS resolver.

I also am currently using a Rapsberry Pi as a Wireguard VPN server.

I am proficient with most modern operating systems including MacOSX, Windows 10, and mainline linux distributions including Manjaro, Ubuntu, and Debian.


## Current Projects
As of right now, I am between projects as my main goal is to upgrade my current networking to 10-Gigabit with the use of fiber optics.

However, I still plan to continue adding to MarkNote as time goes on, as there is much more to do with the project.

## Education
